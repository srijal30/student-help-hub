## Inspiration
My school has a room called the writing center. In the writing center, students can get help on their essays from other students. The writing center really helped me with a lot of my school essays, so I thought why not create something similar to the writing center online! The coins system was inspired by CollegeVine's karma system.

## What it does
HelpHub allows students to get feedback on their essays from other students. To request an essay review, students will have to pay 20 coins. Students can gain coins by helping other students with their essays. This system incentivizes students to help others in order to get help themselves.

## How we built it
The frontend was built with ReactJS and tailwind. The backend api was built with fastapi.

## Challenges we ran into
I joined the funathon when there was only 6 days left until the deadline. Thus, this was a solo project and there was a lot of time pressure to create this project. A lot of ideas had to be scratched in the interest of time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
How functional the app is considering the limited time I had. Also, this was my first real project using ReactJS (which I had only been experimenting with before) and I am really happy with how this project turned out.

## What's next for HelpHub
A rating system in which students can rate the feedback that they are getting from other students to incentivize reviewers to write better reviews in order to receive more coins. Also, there needs to be a few more UI changes.
